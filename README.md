A simple and beginner-friendly Python password strength checker that lets users enter a password normally (visible), then evaluates its strength based on length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. It returns a clear score,from Weak to Very Strong,along with specific reasons so users understand exactly what their password is missing. This project requires only Python 3.8+ and no external libraries, making it easy to run using python checker.py. Built as part of my Python security and automation learning journey, it focuses on clean logic, understandable feedback, and building real developer discipline through small, complete projects.
